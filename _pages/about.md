### About This Blog:


I have mainitained a blog since 2016, but noticed that different crowds have different interests and thus keep ideas around different themes in different places. 

Ronynn's blog in it's current form is dedicated to discussions around all things foss, specially the apps and games I am working on. Apart from those, I often come up with ideas to quantify mundane things to analyse so this is my place to publish those research too. Most of those mundane things focus around productivty and self improvement, as I strive to be one step better than I was before.

Few lines of description from the earlier version of this about page that I changed for being too whimsical yet I find it to be funny:

> I believe that life is too important to be taken seriously—yet, paradoxically, I have chosen to examine it with the utmost seriousness. This blog is my digital salon, a space where I invite you to join me in the whimsical and wondrous world of over-analysis.

> But what, you may ask, is the purpose of all this meticulous tracking? It is, quite simply, to become the best version of myself. To optimize my activities, avoid distractions, and understand my inner workings with the clarity of a crystal ball. Through the medium of stats and charts, I strive to create a life that is both efficient and delightful.

> For in the words of Wilde, “To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.” Here, we do not merely exist; we thrive.
